        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>AFTER DROPPING THEIR ANTHEMIC SINGLE “LEGENDARY” IN 2017, THE INDIE ROCK WORLD WAS QUICKLY INTRODUCED TO
            WELSHLY ARMS’ PENCHANT FOR UNLEASHING LARGER-THAN-LIFE ALT-ROCK BANGERS AND SPINE TINGLING LIVE
            PERFORMANCES. THEIR 2018 ALBUM NO PLACE IS HOME HAS GARNERED OVER 350M TOTAL STREAMS AND PROVIDES A
            SENSATIONAL MUSICAL JOURNEY THAT HITS ALL THE SWAGGERY NOTES. PUT SIMPLY, THE BAND INJECTS A POWERFUL DOSE
            OF EMOTION THAT CONTINUES TO LEAVE THE WELSHLY ARMS’ FAITHFUL ENAMORED.
            THE GROUP’S LATEST RELEASE WASTED WORDS & BAD DECISIONS WAS RECORDED IN AN OLD FARM HOUSE IN THE OUTSKIRTS
            OF CLEVELAND, OHIO AS THE WORLD ENDURED LOCKDOWN. THE TRANQUIL AND COMFORTABLE SETTING PROVIDED THE
            PLATINUM-SELLING FIVE-PIECE BAND A WELCOME RESPITE FROM THE GRUELING DEMANDS OF TOURING STATESIDE AND
            OVERSEAS. “WITH A LONG PAUSE IN TOURING AND LIVE PERFORMANCES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, WE TOOK TIME TO REFLECT
            AND REFOCUS ON OUR MUSIC,” SAYS SAM GETZ [LEAD, SINGER, GUITAR]. “THESE SONGS SPEAK TO WHO WE ALL ARE IN
        </p>
        <img src="img/pngwing.com.png" alt="BAND dp" width="400">
        <p>This Exact MOMENT OF OUR LIVES. MUSICALLY, WE WANTED THIS RECORD TO BRING US BACK TO THE RAW ROCK-N-ROLL
            THAT WE HAD
            BUILT THE BAND ON WHEN WE WERE JAMMING IN THE BASEMENT TOGETHER. BUT, OF COURSE, WE’VE ALSO MATURED AND
            GELLED AS MUSICIANS AFTER TOURING THE WORLD TOGETHER, AND I THINK THAT INTERSECTION IS WHAT MADE WASTED
            WORDS & BAD DECISIONS SO FUN AND REWARDING TO CREATE.”

            AFTER DROPPING THEIR ANTHEMIC SINGLE “LEGENDARY” (NOW A CERTIFIED PLATINUM SINGLE IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN
            COUNTRIES THAT HAS BEEN STREAMED OVER 250 MILLION TIMES) IN 2017, THE FIVE MIDWESTERNERS WERE CATAPULTED
            FROM PLAYING LOCAL MUSIC CLUBS IN CLEVELAND ONTO THE WORLD’S LARGEST ROCK FESTIVAL STAGES INCLUDING
            LOLLAPALOOZA, THE READING & LEEDS FESTIVAL, BOTTLEROCK, ROCK AM RING, HANGOUT MUSIC FEST, SHAKY KNEES, AND
            MORE IN LESS THAN A YEAR’S TIME.

            THE QUICK RISE FOR GETZ, JIMMY WEAVER [BASS, VOCALS], MIKEY GOULD [DRUMS], BRI BRYANT [VOCALS], AND JON
            BRYANT [VOCALS] SAW THE BAND PLAY FOR MASSIVE SOLD-OUT FESTIVAL CROWDS INSTANTLY HOOKED BY “LEGENDARY” AND
            OTHER WELSHLY ARMS’ HITS SUCH AS “INDESTRUCTIBLE”, “LEARN TO LET GO”, AND “SANCTUARY” (THE LATTER TWO WERE
            BOTH TOP TEN SONGS IN GERMANY) IN MERE MONTHS, WELSHLY ARMS BECAME INDIE-ROCK DARLINGS CHERISHED FROM LOS
            ANGELES TO WARSAW.</p>
